Version: 2.00 
Last modified: 19-Oct-2021
Author: 
	DE4A WP3 & WP5 Elements without comments are documented through their types 
	defined in common-types.xsd 
Version control:
- 2.00
	- Support to multi request in one message exchange 
	- Support to Subscription & Notification pattern
	- Support to Lookup pattern
	- Support to the two responses for the USIP evidence request
- 1.02 
	- Typo AddtionalParameters corrected 
- 1.01 
	- Move up AddtionalParameters as an optional list of at least one 
		AddtionalParameterValue 
	- Remove of EvidenceService because it is not the endpoint service 
		but the Evidence Provision concept that is identified by 
		the DO (participant-id) and the C.Evidence Type (document-id) 
	- Change to xml 1.1 to support xs:any and xs:anyType 

Version 1 comments:
	"RequestTransferEvidence" is the element that represents the DR request message 
	to obtain a specific canonical 	evidence from the endpoint of a specific 
	evidence service provided by a DT. 	Such a service is identified in the 
	element "EvidenceServiceData", which also contains the input parameters that 
	the service might require besides the eIDAS mandatory dataset 
	of the evidence subject. 
	
	Besides, the DR that is building the request message must specify in the 
	"ReturnServiceId" element the identificator of the service where the DR is 
	waiting the response message.  The DT can locate the endpoint of such 
	service through the corresponding  SML/SMP component. 
	
	The message is uniquely identified in the whole system 
	by the "RequestID" identifier and is structured according to the IEM request 
	version specified in "SpecificationId". Besides, there is an alternative 
	key that is composed by the elements: 
	- TimeStamp: specific date and time  when the message was created 
	- DataEvaluator: identifier of the competent  authority that is responsible
		 of processing the evidence according to the procedure regulation 
	- DataOwner: identifier of the authority that is responsible 
		of issuing the evidence with legal value 
	- DataRequestSubject: eIDAS mandatory  dataset of the subject of the 
		evidence to be issued, either a legal entity  or a natural person 
		with o without representation 
	- CanonicalEventTypeId:  the requested evidence according to the list of 
		available evidence types  with a canonical form On the other hand, 
		the request message also includes 
	
	"RequestGrounds" with the legal grounds of the request, which might be either 
	a national or European Law or the explicit request of the user to use the 
	cross-border technical system. 
	
	The procedure that requires the  evidence may be identified with 
	the "ProcedureId" element.

			The IEMRequestMsg may include several types of request items.
			Request items related to both the subscription-and-notification
			pattern and the lookup pattern are not linked to a specific
			procedure, so so the information contained in the mandatory element 
			"Procedure" does not need to be processed by any of the participants 
			in these patterns (DE/DR/DT/DO). Potentially, the enum sub-element 
			"ProcedureCategory" might be used by some ex-ante or ex-post 
			authorization controls. Domestic name and uri are not relevant
			so any generic name to describe the purpose of the request is enough.
